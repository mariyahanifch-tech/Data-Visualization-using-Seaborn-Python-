Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).

The docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.

To build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).

Dependencies
------------

Seaborn supports Python 3.8+.

Installation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).


Installation
------------

The latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:

    pip install seaborn

It is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:

    pip install seaborn[stats]

Seaborn can also be installed with conda:

    conda install seaborn

Note that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.

Citing
------

A paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.
